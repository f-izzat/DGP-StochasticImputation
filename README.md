# DGP-StochasticImputation
A C++ implementation of [1] Deep Gaussian Process with Stochastic Imputation. This code was written for my Masters thesis : "Modeling Non-Stationarity with Deep Gaussian Processes: Applications in Aerospace Engineering" [2]. The original Python implementation can be found in (https://github.com/mingdeyu/DGP).

The library depends on several external (header-only) libraries, mainly: `Eigen`, `ThreadPool` and `optim` (https://github.com/kthohr/optim).
However, the main optimizer is an LBFFGSB which requires a Fortran compiler.

The current code is a rough draft and hard to read, although can run. This repo is currently in progress.  

TODO:

- Rewrite demo.cpp
- Remove optim
- Add LBFGSB header-only
- Add CMakeLists.txt
